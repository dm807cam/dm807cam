### Hi my name is Dennis 👋
I am a third year PhD student at the University of Cambridge 🇬🇧 and the British Antarctic Survey where my research is about understanding the processes and pathways of biomineralization in marine invertebrates and their ecological implications. 

**My reserach interests are broadly about:**
- 🐚 How marine organisms produce shells.
- 🌊 How climate change will influence marine calcifiers.
- 💎 How biominerals can be used to study the oceans of the past.

### What I am currently working on...

Currently I work on the R package **EMPiR** which is a pipe-friendly framework to import, calibrate and evaluate Electron MicroProbe data in R. This project is still work in progress and I hope to release a first stable version at the end of November, 2021.
